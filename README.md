Customer Feedback Analysis
Description:

Performed an in-depth sentiment analysis on a large collection of Amazon product reviews using NLP techniques, classifying feedback into positive, neutral, and negative categories.
Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling to uncover recurring themes in customer opinions, including product quality, shipping performance, and customer support.
Presented findings visually through bar graphs, sentiment distribution plots, and word clouds to highlight major concerns and patterns in customer sentiment.
Developed actionable recommendations aimed at addressing common customer pain points and enhancing overall satisfaction.

Conclusion:

This analysis offered clear insights into customer sentiment and recurring themes found in Amazon product reviews. Sentiment analysis revealed a high proportion of feedback centered on product quality, delivery timelines, and support-related issues.
LDA topic modeling identified key areas where customers expressed both satisfaction and dissatisfaction, helping pinpoint strengths and areas that require improvement. Negative feedback primarily referenced concerns such as product durability, delivery delays, and inadequate post-purchase support, while positive reviews emphasized ease of use and product reliability.
Visual representations, including word clouds and sentiment breakdowns, provided an accessible overview of these trends. Based on these results, strategic recommendations were made to strengthen quality control, streamline shipping operations, and improve customer service to enhance the overall customer experience.
